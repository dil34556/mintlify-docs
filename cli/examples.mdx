# Usage Examples

Learn how to use the Telminator CLI with practical examples.

## Connecting to a Different Agent

You can connect to any agent by passing its URL with the `--agent` flag:

### Basic Connection

Connect to the default Telminator agent:
```bash
uv run . --agent http://agent.telminator.com:10002/
```

### Connect to a Custom Agent

Connect to any A2A-compatible agent:
```bash
uv run . --agent https://sample-a2a-agent-908687846511.us-central1.run.app
```

<Note>
The agent URL must include the protocol (`http://` or `https://`) and end with a forward slash `/`
</Note>

## Managing Multiple Agents

### Add a New Agent

Save an agent to your configuration for quick access:
```bash
uv run . --add --agent http://agent.telminator.com:10002/
```

**What happens:**
- The agent is saved with a unique ID
- You can switch to it later without typing the full URL
- Authentication settings are stored securely

### Example Output
```
Setting up: http://agent.telminator.com:10002/
⚠️  Authentication required
ℹ️  API key required in 'Telmini-API-Key' header

Enter your Telmini-API-Key: tel*********************

✓ Authentication configured
✓ Saved as ID: 43dc55fe
✓ Connected
```

### Switch Between Agents

During a session, type `switch` to change agents:
```bash
You (): switch
```

The CLI will show you all saved agents and let you choose one.

## Common Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Quick Test

Test an agent quickly without saving:
```bash
uv run . --agent http://agent.telminator.com:10002/
```

### Pattern 2: Regular Use

Add your frequently-used agents:
```bash
# Add agent once
uv run . --add --agent http://agent.telminator.com:10002/

# Connect anytime using the saved ID
uv run .
```

### Pattern 3: Multiple Environments

Save different agents for different purposes:
```bash
# Production agent
uv run . --add --agent https://prod-agent.telminator.com/

# Development agent
uv run . --add --agent http://dev-agent.telminator.com:8080/

# Testing agent
uv run . --add --agent http://localhost:10001/
```

## Example Session

Here's what a typical session looks like:

### Step 1: Start the CLI
```bash
uv run . --agent http://agent.telminator.com:10002/
```

### Step 2: Authenticate
```
Setting up: http://agent.telminator.com:10002/
⚠️  Authentication required

Enter your Telmini-API-Key: tel*********************

✓ Connected
```

### Step 3: View Agent Info
```
Agent Info
┌─────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Name        │ Currency Agent                           │
│ About       │ Helps with exchange rates for currencies │
│ Version     │ 1.0.0                                    │
│ Streaming   │ ✓                                        │
└─────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────┘

Session: 0019c38153b14ca9...
Type 'exit' or 'quit' to leave, 'switch' to change agent
```

### Step 4: Send a Query
```
You (): What is the exchange rate from USD to EUR?
```

### Step 5: Get Response
```
Agent: The current exchange rate from USD to EUR is approximately 0.92.
       For 100 USD, you would get about 92 EUR.
```

### Step 6: Continue or Exit
```
You (): Thanks!

You (): quit
```

## Advanced Examples

### Working with Files

Attach files to your queries:
```bash
You (): Can you analyze this data?
Select a file path to attach? (press enter to skip): /path/to/data.csv

[Agent processes the file]
Agent: I've analyzed your CSV file. Here are the key insights...
```

### Multi-turn Conversations

The CLI maintains context across multiple messages:
```bash
You (): What's the USD to EUR rate?
Agent: The current rate is 0.92 USD to EUR.

You (): And for 500 USD?
Agent: 500 USD would be approximately 460 EUR.

You (): What about GBP?
Agent: 500 USD is approximately 395 GBP.
```

## Agent URLs Quick Reference

| Environment | URL | Purpose |
|-------------|-----|---------|
| **Production** | `https://agent.telminator.com:10001/` | Live production agents |
| **Demo** | `http://agent.telminator.com:10002/` | Demo and testing |
| **Local** | `http://localhost:10001/` | Local development |
| **Custom** | Your agent URL | Self-hosted agents |

## Command Reference

### Connection Commands
```bash
# Connect to an agent
uv run . --agent <URL>

# Add and save an agent
uv run . --add --agent <URL>

```

### Session Commands

During a session, use these commands:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `exit` or `quit` | End the session and exit |
| `switch` | Switch to a different saved agent |
| `:q` | Quick exit (alternative) |

## Troubleshooting Examples

### Connection Refused
```bash
Error: Connection refused at http://agent.telminator.com:10002/
```

**Solution:** Check if the agent URL is correct and the agent is running.

### Authentication Failed
```bash
Error: Authentication failed (401 Unauthorized)
```

**Solution:** Verify your API key is correct and hasn't expired. Get a new key from [app.telminator.com](https://app.telminator.com/#api-keys).

### Invalid Agent URL
```bash
Error: Invalid agent URL format
```

**Solution:** Ensure the URL includes:
- Protocol: `http://` or `https://`
- Trailing slash: `/`

Example: `https://agent.telminator.com:10001/` ✅

## Tips & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Save Your Frequently Used Agents">
    Use `--add` to save agents you use regularly. This saves time and reduces typing errors.
```bash
    uv run . --add --agent http://agent.telminator.com:10002/
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names">
    When you save agents, give them descriptive names in your notes to remember what each one does.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test in Demo First">
    Before using production agents, test your queries in the demo environment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep API Keys Secure">
    Never share your API keys in screenshots or logs. Store them securely in environment variables.
