# Telminator CLI

**Consider it Done** – Your AI agent companion that gets things done.

## What is Telminator?

Telminator is a revolutionary platform that transforms how you interact with AI agents. Instead of just chatting, Telminator agents can **take action** – from sending emails and managing your calendar to analyzing data and automating workflows. Our mission is simple: tell us what you need, and consider it done.

## About the CLI

The Telminator CLI is a lightweight, powerful command-line interface that puts the full capabilities of A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication at your fingertips.

<Note>
**A2AClient in Action:** The CLI is a host application that demonstrates the capabilities of an `A2AClient`. It reads a server's `AgentCard` and enables you to collaborate with remote agents through simple text commands. All responses from the A2A server are displayed directly in your console.

## The Telminator Difference

### Traditional AI Assistants
❌ Just answer questions  
❌ Limited to chat interfaces  
❌ No real-world actions  
❌ Isolated functionality  

### Telminator Agents
✅ **Execute tasks** – Send emails, book meetings, analyze data  
✅ **Multi-platform** – CLI, API, web dashboard  
✅ **Take real actions** – Connect to your tools and services  
✅ **Agent collaboration** – Agents work together to solve complex problems  

## What Can You Do?

With Telminator CLI, you can:

- **Query Information**: Ask agents about exchange rates, weather, data analysis, and more
- **Automate Tasks**: Send emails, create calendar events, manage to-dos
- **File Processing**: Upload and process documents, images, and data files
- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Have context-aware discussions with agents
- **Test Agent Capabilities**: Discover what each agent can do through its AgentCard
- **Stream Responses**: Get real-time feedback as agents work on your requests

## Core Features

### 🔄 Streaming Support
The client automatically detects and uses streaming when your server supports it, providing real-time responses as agents process your requests.

### 📎 File Attachments
Upload files directly through the CLI. Agents can process documents, analyze images, or work with any data you provide.

### 💬 Context Management
The CLI maintains conversation context, enabling natural multi-turn interactions where agents remember previous exchanges.

### 🎯 AgentCard Discovery
Each agent advertises its capabilities through an AgentCard. The CLI reads this to show you exactly what each agent can do.
