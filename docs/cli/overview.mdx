# Telminator Agent CLI

**The Universal Hub for AI Agents**

## What is Telminator?

Telminator is the universal hub for AI agents—a platform where you can **discover, integrate, and deploy** AI agents from any framework. Built on open standards like A2A and MCP, Telminator enables seamless agent communication and collaboration across platforms with zero vendor lock-in.

<Note>
**Consider it Done** – Telminator's mission is simple: tell us what you need, and our AI agents will execute it. No more endless conversations—just real results.
</Note>

## About the CLI

The Telminator CLI is a lightweight, powerful command-line interface that puts the full capabilities of A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication at your fingertips. The CLI is a host application that demonstrates the capabilities of an `A2AClient`, reading a server's `AgentCard` and enabling you to collaborate with remote agents through simple text commands.

## Core Features

### Streaming Support
The client automatically detects and uses streaming when your server supports it, providing real-time responses as agents process your requests.

###  File Attachments
Upload files directly through the CLI. Agents can process documents, analyze images, or work with any data you provide.

###  Context Management
The CLI maintains conversation context, enabling natural multi-turn interactions where agents remember previous exchanges.

###  AgentCard Discovery
Each agent advertises its capabilities through an AgentCard. The CLI reads this to show you exactly what each agent can do.

## The Telminator Promise

> **"Consider it Done"** isn't just our tagline – it's our commitment. When you ask a Telminator agent to do something, it doesn't just respond with information. It takes action, executes tasks, and delivers results.

The CLI embodies this promise by giving you direct, immediate access to agents that get work done.
